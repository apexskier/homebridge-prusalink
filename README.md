# Homebridge Prusalink

Use your Prusa 3D printer as a temperature sensor.

This plugin reads temperature from the bed and nozzle sensors of a Prusa (tested on the MK4) 3D printer. If the printer is actively heating or the temps are significantly different (a proxy for cooling down) it marks itself as inactive (not perfect, but works most of the time).
